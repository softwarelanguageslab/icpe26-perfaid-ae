Figure 6: perfaid campaign for LevelDB with different lock implementations.

Paper reference:
    Section 4.1 (Studying Locking Impact with perfaid), Figure 6.

What this script does:
    Demonstrates how to use shared libraries (via LD_PRELOAD) to inject
    different lock implementations into a benchmark without modifying its
    source code. The Tilt library (libmutrep) interposes pthread mutex
    calls and replaces them with the selected spinlock algorithm.

    Lock algorithms tested: CAS, TTAS, Ticket, MCS, Hemlock, CNA, HMCS,
    and the default glibc pthread_mutex baseline.

Hardware used in the paper:
    Platform B - NUMA server (2x Kunpeng 920-4826, 96 cores, aarch64).
    Works on any Linux machine; thread counts are automatically filtered
    to the number of available CPUs.

Expected execution time:
    ~15 minutes (8 locks x 7 thread counts x 3 runs x 10 s ~= 1680 s,
    reduced on machines with fewer than 32 cores).

Prerequisites:
    - System packages: build-essential, cmake, libsnappy-dev
    - Python environment set up (see README)
    - The Tilt shared library is built automatically by the script

How to run:
    cd examples/
    python fig06_leveldb_locks.py

Output:
    - CSV results and a line-plot (PNG/PDF) in ~/.benchkit/results/
    - Line plot shows throughput vs. thread count, one line per lock
