Figure 3: perfaid campaign sweeping all available CPUs for the sequential heater.

Paper reference:
    Section 3.2 (Sequential CPU-ID Characterization), Figure 3.

What this script does:
    Runs a simple compute-bound workload (sequential heater) pinned to each
    logical CPU in turn, measuring the number of arithmetic operations
    completed in a fixed time window. This reveals the relative speed of
    each core and exposes P-core vs. E-core asymmetry on hybrid processors.

    The heater is a tight C loop that counts operations while pinned via
    sched_setaffinity. perfaid sweeps all CPUs declaratively.

Hardware used in the paper:
    Platform A - hybrid-core laptop (AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, 24 cores).
    Works on any Linux machine; results will reflect whatever core topology
    is present (homogeneous machines show a flat bar chart).

Expected execution time:
    ~3 minutes on a 24-core machine (24 CPUs x 3 runs x 3 s ~= 216 s).
    Scales linearly with core count.

Prerequisites:
    - System packages: build-essential, cmake
    - Python environment set up (see README)

How to run:
    cd examples/
    python fig03_heater.py

Output:
    - CSV results and a bar-plot (PNG/PDF) in ~/.benchkit/results/
    - Bar plot shows operations per CPU, revealing P/E core clusters
