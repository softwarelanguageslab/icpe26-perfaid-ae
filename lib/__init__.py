Shared utilities for ICPE'26 perfaid artifact experiments.

This package (`lib/`) provides the reusable helper layer that all example and
experiment scripts import. It encapsulates the artifact-specific configuration
that sits between the generic benchkit framework and the individual figure
scripts, keeping the scripts concise and DRY.

Modules:
    platforms   Platform detection: recognizes known servers (e.g., "algol" ->
                Kunpeng 96-core NUMA) and falls back to auto-detection.
    locks       Lock library configuration: generates Tilt (libmutrep) shared
                libraries for LD_PRELOAD-based pthread_mutex interposition.
                Supports CAS, TTAS, Ticket, MCS, Hemlock (flat) and CNA, HMCS
                (NUMA-aware hierarchical).
    schedulers  Scheduler integration: provides SchedProcess, a manager for the
                schedkit (UserPlace) daemon, with pre/post-run hooks that start
                and stop scheduling policies (Normal, FAR, CLOSE, AsymSched,
                SAM, SAS) around each benchmark run.
    panels      Panel dataclass: organizes multi-benchmark, multi-panel figures
                (used by fig07_locks.py and fig10_schedulers.py).
    flame       Flame graph utilities: post-run hooks for generating individual
                and differential flame graphs from perf record data.
    lockgen/    Lock code generation: generates Tilt-compatible C wrappers from
                libvsync spinlock headers and HMCS lock templates.

Exported symbols (for ``from lib import ...``):
    get_platform, get_tilt_lib, get_locks, LOCKS, PRETTY_LOCKS,
    get_scheduler, SCHEDULERS, PRETTY_SCHEDULERS,
    Panel, flame_post_hook, generate_differential_flamegraph.
