Figure 9: perfaid campaign for LevelDB with different scheduling policies.

Paper reference:
    Section 4.2 (Studying Thread-Placement Impact with perfaid), Figure 9.

What this script does:
    Demonstrates how to compose scheduling policies with benchmarks using
    pre/post run hooks. Before each run, the UserPlace daemon (schedkit)
    is started with the policy drawn from the parameter space; after each
    run it is stopped. Six policies are compared: Normal (default Linux),
    FAR, CLOSE, AsymSched, SAM, and SAS.

Hardware used in the paper:
    Platform B - NUMA server (2x Kunpeng 920-4826, 96 cores, aarch64).
    Works on any Linux machine; on non-NUMA machines the NUMA-aware
    policies may not show meaningful differences.

Expected execution time:
    ~15 minutes (6 schedulers x 7 thread counts x 3 runs x 10 s ~= 1260 s).

Prerequisites:
    - System packages: build-essential, cmake, libsnappy-dev
    - Python environment set up (see README)
    - schedkit is built automatically

How to run:
    cd examples/
    python fig09_leveldb_schedulers.py

Output:
    - CSV results and a line-plot (PNG/PDF) in ~/.benchkit/results/
    - Line plot shows throughput vs. thread count, one line per scheduler
